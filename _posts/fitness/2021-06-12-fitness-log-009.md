 - Successfully through a week of retraining.
 - DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness) as expected
   - have been experimenting with thermal recovery lately
	 - start with 0 degree ice bath, switch it up to hot water and hit
       the recently exercised muscle groups, switch back to ice bath
       after a couple of minutes; twice a day.
	 - definitely helps : sleeping better.
   - missed full body soreness.
 - was a damage-control oriented week.
   - pressing (overhead and bench) did not suffer a lot, due to
     regular OAP oriented evening sessions.
   - squats and deadlifts took a hit.
	 - regular lunges did help with retaining muscle but couldn't
       provide the same stimulus as the above.
 - cardiovascular health maintained due to regular weighted jump
   rope workouts
 - immediately observable posture improvements and joint health due to
   reinstating [TGUs,SDLs and CaLs]({% post_url
   /fitness/2021-03-31-fitness-log-002 %}).
 - the old 6 days a week but reduced down a couple over overlapping
   sets for the last 3 days.
