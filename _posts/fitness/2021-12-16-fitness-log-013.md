 - last semester was hectic
 - exerted more that usually habituated to
 - all anchoring habits were displaced by compulsive behaviors during the last two weeks
 - the last day, in hopes of finishing off all pending work before I
   travel: was awake for a stretch of 40 hours with polyphasic sleep
   with the longest bout being around ~45 mins (total of ~2 hours)
 - haven't recovered yet (been a week)
			- recovery entails good sleep, caffeine independence,
              morning workouts, unsupervised healthy hydration
 - all of that, and more, is out of whack
 - feels like a Circadian Calamity 
 - major intentional rehabilitation needed
	 - will experience immense circadian inertia and will need an
       equivalent force of will to normalize it all
