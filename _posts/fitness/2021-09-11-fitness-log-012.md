 - That heading is my best unintended attempt ever at visual but not a
   phonetic alliteration 
 - post being quarantined upon arrival to my university, I've deviated
   heavily from my routine due to several reasons
 - workouts have been suffering due to sleep deprivation and I don't
   intend to hold on to the habit of pseudo "catch-ups" (sleeping is
   not a temporally linear act : two 4 hour sessions aren't equivalent to one 8
   hour session)
   - that has been amplified due to the fact that I haven't been
     consuming my usual pre-workout: (black coffee with ghee) for a
     while due to reasons best attributed to inconvenience and laziness
   - that led me into thinking that I should buy a pre-workout
   - that led me into thinking that that will fuck up my sleep even
     more
   - that led me convincing myself to quit caffeine for good this
     time
	 - did it for around ~6 weeks some months ago and sleep improved
       drastically (especially REM and deep sleep phases (I track my
       sleep via a FitBit so question the reliability accordingly))
	   - frequent lucid dreams and stable energy levels throughout the
         day with no crashes or jittery surges
 - workouts will temporarily take a hit but should feel healthier and
   less groggy over a period of one week
 - virtual lectures to the rescue: I can sleep like a baby
   anytime I please.
 - haven't thought about how I'm going to bring napping into the
   picture yet.
   - Have picked up the perfect [book]({% post_url /books/2021-01-17-WhyWeSleep %})for a bedtime read, again.....
	 - third time's a charm
	 - I need the negative reinforcement I guess
