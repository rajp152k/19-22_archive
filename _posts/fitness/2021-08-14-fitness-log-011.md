Have begun damage control for all the performance losses incurred
during past two months.

Strength routines are in place and progressive overload is doing its
job.  

[Prehabbing]({% post_url /fitness/2021-03-31-fitness-log-002 %}) 
exercises show promise: feel more stable and confident when handling
resistance and just moving about my daily routine in general.  

Ramping up conditioning routines: A mixture of weighted and speed
ropes 20 mins a session, 4 sessions a week seems to be adequate right
now. Have also incorporated some high rep hindu squat sessions  and
observing gradual improvement in knee and ankle well-being: I'm 21 right now so this
is more of a  prehabbing strategy right now. Slowly incorporating more
training styles : should help with keeping workouts fun. 

Beginning to periodize in blocks of 2 weeks starting this Monday: will
observe effects and log along the way.

In a phase where I need to invest some will for some time to daemonize
these routines.
