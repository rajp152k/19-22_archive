It's been some time [I last declared]({% post_url /fitness/2021-04-21-fitness-log-004 %}) that I'm getting into these.

Got my first one yesterday evening and this is a brief summary of the phases I went through during the progression

#### Fitness Log 005 : First Double Under

---

### Speed ropes

	- tangle a lot : only use once you are compentent enough with the particular move
	- can do all the skills transferred from the beaded rope mentioned below with them now
    - taking a break from them during the learning process : trying replacements and strategizing

### Strategic perspective

	- Goal was to accelerate the process with some theory
	- I take 18 seconds for 50 single unders with a speed rope : 0.36 seconds for 1 pass
	- Double unders require a combination of jumping higher and spinning the rope faster
	- That would mean an (approximate) an event duration which is ..
		- dangerously close to the sensitivity of vision and hearing for humans : analysis in real time is stupid
		- have to control a lot of minor muscles and the way to go about it is practice and not an algorithmic approach : The senses are a bottleneck
    - time to use some neurofeedback training : switching to heavier ropes

### Auxiliary Tricks : Beaded Ropes

	- solid feedback but a lot of friction : can't pickup the pace
	- learned a lot from them : double side swings, tyson squats, criss-crosses
	- strategy is to learn from these and transfer to other rope types easily
    - side swipes are the prominent ones here that are useful for trick transitions
	
### Setting the Scene

	- Watched this two days ago
	- This is what I followed closely and helped me get into the rythm
	- Setting an entry point with the double side swipe
	- one bounce followed by the double under
   
### Weighted rope

	- I wanted to take the neurofeedback to the next level
	- bought a 1 pound (~0.45 kilo) weighted rope (pvc) that doesn't tangle
	- took around 10 mins of practice to get the basics transferred from the beaded rope 
	- This is a lot of feedback and just sky-rocketted the whole process
		- after 30 mins...
  
 
#### VOILA:

#### Thoughts:

	- still need to work on my landing after the first normal jump post the double under : a lot of backward momentum can be observed
	- workouts are more fun now
	- yet to string multiples
