Gyms are functional again from today onwards (Mon Jun  7 2021). This
allows me get back on my regimen : was missing this.

 - waking up at 04:50 with the same-old vigor again
   - Lucidity practices will be taking a hit: 
	 - most vivid sessions have been during morning hours
	 - albeit, this dream holds higher priority
 - going caffeine-free : acclimitized to the stable throughput
   - used to have huge crashes by 10:00 before
	 - really messed up the circadian rythms: noon and midnight felt
       like the other should have.
 - Due to countermeasures, haven't experienced considerable muscle
   loss but still not going to lift at full capacity for 2 weeks.
   - will get used to the neural patterns and use this time to reset
     the circadian rythms, establishing the routine as before.
   - won't be testing PRs for some time
 - Re-initiating with a frequency(6 days/week) as it was pre-halt
   - as I already used calisthenics and weighted jump ropes with
     almost the same frequency
	 
This affects my current experiment of going [Music and
Podcast-free]({% post_url /meta/2021-05-22-break-music-podcasts %})
I would rather have my music loop in my head than what the average
gymmer prefers.  
The acumen has been elaborated upon in the original post.
