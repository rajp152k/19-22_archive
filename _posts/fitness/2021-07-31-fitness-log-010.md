The past month has been very mediocre in terms of being generically
healthy and fit. Caught a cold due to seasonal changes that lasted
almost 1.5 weeks, costing me all the lost time in the gym
resulting in temporary strength and morale losses.  

## Sucks to be sick ...  

Intellectual capacities dwindle down to that of a zombie, stamina
takes a hit, out of breath easily, muscle control suffers, you are
just a sub-optimal being on the whole in all aspects.  

I usually approach such situations with a fair amount of aggression
and that blinds me towards opportunities to recover efficiently and
smartly. However, the same aggression helps me go above and beyond
preparing for when I really do recover, I mentally instate a feud
against whatever actions/behaviors led to that situation and make sure
I don't fall for it that easily again.

This time:
 - upping the amount of greens I consume
 - incorporating some deliberate breath-work
 - "HYDRATE BITCH": mentally tattooing this on my forehead
 - increasing work in the max HR zone to up my VO2 max and heat up the body
 - the moment I detect the possibility of a cold in the coming days,
   go rogue with counter-measures

## The bright side 

I rarely get sick and as a result don't sympathize well with people
who are sick but such phases do serve as a reminder to be more
considerate towards ones not well.
