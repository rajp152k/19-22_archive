## One Arm Pushups

 - progressing with archer-pushups now
 - been 5 sessions with noticable progress:
   - started out with being able to do 3 strict palm supported with
     each hand
   - could do 10 palm supported with each hand by the third session
   - could do 5 finger supported (thumb included) with each hand today
   - also tried OAP eccentrics at the fourth session, but still lack
     the necessary control
	  - will re-employ once am able to do 10 finger-supported with
        each hand
 - breath control has improved over the sessions
   - as the number of reps increase, breathing once per rep is a
     better choice than sustaining the valsalva maneuver throughout
     the set
 - have been noticing strength improvements and tricep hypertrophy
 - soreness is a good indicator of novel stimuli
   - fairly quick adaptation expected.

## Coffee

 - was off this for more than a month
 - have been consuming minimal amounts for 60 hours now
   - eyes have been drier than usual with the same hydration and sleep
   - no noticable energy improvements
   - an nap(25 mins) or a complete sleep cycle(90 mins (sleep deprived
     days)) are a much better option
 - discontinuing indefinitely. Only consuming when absolutely necessary.
 - will keep the sensitivity preserved for emergencies
   - a zombie apocalypse, for instance
	 - I don't have a shotgun yet.
	 - a sledgehammer would be slow
	 - machetes should be fun
	 - katanas would be epic
	 - also don't have a horse yet.
	 - also probably won't have zombies.

## One Meal a Day

 - had been doing this for 2 weeks 
 - shifting back to the normal 2 meals + auxiliaries a day now due to
   a revision in workout regimen
 - Convenient experience : saves time 
   - the one meal has to be good though
   - the self imposed obligation takes care of really having a good meal
