 - My right knee has been hurting due a bad lunge a couple of weeks ago.
 - Running seems to get the blood flowing around lower body musculature and joints and also helps with sleep.
 - I am a jump rope guy but running is an essential skill : like swimming; bringing it up to a respectable baseline.
 - Also helps with posture and recovery runs help maintain uniformity on recovery days.
 - I am incorporating them slowly and taking it easy.
    - experienced numerous hamstring pulls when I picked up sprinting last year; had to give up prematurely.
 - Dawns ( 05:20 - 05:50 hrs ) are a good time to run : the skies are deep azure with permeating orange and the breezes are calmly cool.
 - Priorities are still inclined towards strength and resistance training
 - a step towards becoming a hybrid athlete
