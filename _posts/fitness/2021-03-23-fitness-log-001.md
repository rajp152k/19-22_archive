This is a brief profile of my most frequent injury pattern and the canonical causes for the same.  

#### Fitness Log 001 : lower back injuries

### Essence

|Attr| Value|
|---|---|
|Event|        Lower Back Injury @ Romanian Deadlifts while practicing hook grip|
|Event Time-stamp|  Tue mar 23 07:32:38 IST 2021 minus ~60 mins|
|Suspected Cause| Fatigue due to bad chronic posture|
|Experience|  painful : as if someone stuck a knife in my spine|
|Expected Time to Recover | 2 days? :-/ |

### Exhaustive

#### Aversion 

- Practice humility
- sleep with correct posture : extended(7 hours +) lateral stress(shear) on the lower back identified as the prime cause
    - On such days, workout but only to maintain routine: do not seek to break PRs and/or tax your CNS learning new moves
    - try to sustain psychological momentum on such days and take corrective actions immediately

#### Rehabilitation

- Cold Therapy : a lot of cold-showers, ice packs and ice baths if possible
- Deloading : take a break from the heavy compounds for a couple of days
    - do not stop lifting all together : lift light to maintain the periodic stimulus
        - do not train CNS : only the movement patterns
    - evening walks for 30 mins : intentionally reinforce correct spine posture
    - gradually increase loads : take up to a week to get to the norm
- Nutrition : increase fat intake (nuts, clarified butter, yolks)

### Final Note to Self

It is okay, and smarter, to not give your all on certain days and only train to sustain momentum. Check your ego out the weight room.


### UPDATE @ Wed Mar 24 20:50:16 IST 2021

Status approximately after 40 hours:

 - Feeling considerably better
    - back to average mobility fairly quickly
 - several mobility stretches help a lot and significantly accelerate recovery
 - could not lift today, will be able to tomorrow
 - was able to catch up on my sleep deficit though
 - also began engineering a good, quick warm-up routine that is resistant to laziness and the temptation to grip & rip
    - a stretching routine update might follow, covering all that I do for maintaining and enhancing flexibility, mobility, recovery and any other factors I might be missing out.
