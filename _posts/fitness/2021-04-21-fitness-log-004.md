#### Fitness log 004

Due to a surge of Covid-19 cases in India, and Maharashtra specifically, a curfew has been imposed in Nashik. That's all okay and necessary.   
However, that implies I need to revise my training cycles. Calisthenics or plyometrics can't really replace the neural benefits that accompany a deadlift, but can't just sit and complain.

For the coming training cycle, restating the goals as follows:
 
 - maintain muscle and lose fat
 - increase VO2 max
 - learn specific skills that I usually wouldn't have the freedom to work on directly for extended durations
 - stick to a healthy circadian rhythm that is in alignment with the previous routine
     - so as to leverage Inertia for 
        - momentum carryover
        - efficient transitions into the next routine

For now, focusing on learning to time consistent double unders. Right now, it feels like someone's hammering a nail into the tendons and calves, but the body will adapt as always.  
Doing this every other day spruced with recovery walks and a healthy amount of pushups and pullups.
