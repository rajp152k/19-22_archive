## Thoughts and Tips
 - The core needs to be tensed to counter balance the excess torque
   - a prominent difference between conventionals and one-arm

 - will also strengthen the ligaments and tendons around the elbows and joints along the way
 - not a lot of hypertrophy benefits : stick to normal pushups for that
