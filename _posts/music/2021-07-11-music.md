 - I bought a keyboard around a week ago
 - following "Fundamentals of Music Theory" by University of Edinburgh on Coursera
 - also learning via a lot of online resources
   - a notable one being Zebra-keys
 - I played the keyboard for a couple of years when I was around 10
   years old but never discovered music as a whole along with it.
   - starting as a beginner this time and current goal is to get the
     basics right and approach an instructor when I need customized guidance
 - practicing around 30 mins on weekdays and around an hour on the
   weekends.
 - even practicing something mediocre feels better than listening to
   something great. 
   - opinions about this were initially addressed [here]({% post_url /ramblings/2021-05-25-inducing-burnouts %})
 - this serves as a stream regarding whatever I learn and find
   interesting over the years 
 - Along with the basics of music theory, I've been focusing on
   getting comfortable with the arrangement and the structural
   relations of the keyboard as a whole
   - one may memorize where a C falls and continue calculating other
     notes from there on-wards but that quickly becomes a bottle neck
     and so I've been practicing caching all the keys and their
     relative positions directly in my mind by playing a randomly
     asked note. I'm also learning sheet music along the way and
     still rely upon landmark notes and abbreviations so those
     relations are what I intend to imprint collectively in my senses
		- A typical relation set would be:
			- a particular note(textual) 
			- relative position of that note on the keyboard
			- its staff notation
			- the optimal fingering depending upon the context
			- how the note sounds on a particular octave
		- one could use a random note generator like the one in python
          below to deliberately index into these senses 
		
```python
import time
import random
import art

notes = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G']

try:
    while(1):
        print()
        print(art.text2art(random.choice(notes),font='block'))
        print()
        time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Terminating process")
```

 - this first log is an accumulation of thoughts over the past 4 days
   and hence longer than the expected future log
