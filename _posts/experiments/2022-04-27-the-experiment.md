I have been letting this thought simmer in my head for quite a while
now. I finally seem to have a direction in mind when it comes to my
logging - writing, YouTube and whatever media I branch into the
future - pursuits.  

Adding in YouTube to the mix has really accelerated the ideation
process as that adds a whole another dimension to generating content
and expressing my ideas.  

Over the course of the past two weeks (~18 videos and several
blog-posts), I've thought hard about what I do in the future could
look like. I've intent-fully talked about these set of assertions with a lot of
friends now - making it a point to be extravagant and sounding like
I'm being too ambitious. With the intention of embarrassing and
grounding myself. I've given it enough time and after receiving mostly
positive reactions - even from the most critical of friends - I'm
finally formalizing "The Experiment".  

I've only recently formulated that [I'm an Ã¦frisk]({% post_url /updates/2022-04-17-aefraisk %}) and will be
branching out into several superficially segregated domains over the
course of my life soon. The catch being I wish to be more than just
average at these domains.

Alright, so after a lot of journaling and figuring out the parameters
and indicators of progress for "The Experiment", I've decided that I
will not be able to cover it all appropriately in a single blog post.  

Therefore, I've decided to write my first book ever over the month of
May.  

I will be proceeding in a more structured manner this time and have
chosen not to read any "How to write books" books. I wish to figure out the
process that suits me the best organically rather than adapt to an
existing author's style.  

I will be writing in Emacs, in org-mode using the org-roam extension
to allow for connections to be observed easily.  

This will be my first large-scale structured effort to create written
content.  

I will not be talking about "The Experiment" in person with anyone
until I finish the book so that I don't fall prey to the fallacy of
enjoying pseudo-rewards one receives simply by talking about what
they're going to do.  

I will simultaneously continue with the usual pursuits of the blogging
and YouTube.  

I will refrain from using any neologisms in the book unless really necessary in
and want it to be as noise-free as possible.  

This is the first time in a long while where I'm writing not for just
myself, but for something that's bigger than me.
