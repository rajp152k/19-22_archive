My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3042279190">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The way Leonardo's experiences are structured and presented, allow you to see anything and everything in a different light ; also highlighting the explicit simplicity (unconditional curiosity) and the complexity of his character being mingled into his doings- the way seemingly random(which they were) mental excursions led to masterpieces, or to massive fails.<br /><br />Walter also emphasizes on the fact that all this genius was earned and not a mere probabilistic event, all the while retaining the core of Leonardo's life, untainted.<br /><br />This did inspire me to maintain a notebook for my random observations in hopes to nourish my curiosity muscles. Hope to continue with them till the day I die.<br /><br />"Just for the sake of it" - that's one thing that anyone can benefit from embodying... fust for the sake of it.
