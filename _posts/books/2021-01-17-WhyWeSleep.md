My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3740330669">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The book does a very good job of putting you to sleep. This is my third time picking it up and the signal to noise(auxillary signals one could argue) ratio is just too minute for someone looking for a core know of why one needs to prioritise sleep. <br /><br />Take this with a pinch of salt, as I am biased. I'd rather sleep for optimising performance and lucid dreaming than to avoid Alzheimer's; those get me intrigued about the idea of sleep. Albeit he has sections for them, they are just a very small part of the whole.<br />How the author comes through makes me feel as though I am enslaved by the idea of sleep.<br /><br />If you're like me, I suggest you look into that territory (a lot of good,concise books in that domain). They will excite you to sleep and not demotivate you to not sleep.<br /><br />This is one book tending to multiple people/people at different points in their lives at once.
