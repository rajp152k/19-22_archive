My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3258611731">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Born in 2000, all I grew up with was the posthumous popularity of Bruce Lee. A poster hangs in my dorm room, Bruce clenching his fists, stating, "As you think, so shall you become" - one of his many tenets. Alongside this read, Bruce was progressively humanized with all his wishes, vices, and germinating philosophies leading to a transient viewpoint throughout. I finish the book with a clearer tintless picture of the whole, getting to know much more about him. The book demystifies the "magic" associated with him to the "tricks" he was disciplined enough to master.
