 - Officially ceasing to actively track the number of books I read: up to
43 books for 2021.
 - Will also not be rating them on unidimensional scales: only reviews
   - will make exceptions only in the case I feel like putting down some works that are not worth spreading.
 - counting does bias choices irrationally: longer tougher reads that
   require persistence are definitely more valuable than shorts that
   can be consumed in a couple of days.
 - Also still convinced about only sticking to non-fiction and don't
   feel like being considerate of fiction any time-soon: good literature included.
 - Expecting frequent book reviews.
 - will also be spending more time with textbooks - not just my
   principal domain but taking a much more miscellaneous approach:
	- meteorology
	- geography, cartography
	- practical astronomy
	- chemistry
	- anatomy
	- rhetoric
	- mechanics
	- economics
	- linguistics
	- music theory
	- neuroscience, nutrition, physiology
	- anthropology
	- will continue to add on to the list
 - final aim continues to be able to appreciate all these from a
   uniform perspective
 - All this while empirically pursuing epistemology and trying to
   build some of my own 
 - will be starting comment streams for each technically involved domain
 - will also have exploration sessions on wikipedia where I read
   whimsically and find potential intellectual interests
	   - wikipedia is a very good tool for aspiring polymaths
 - Not counting does somewhat free me mentally of keeping track.
       - will begin including landmark research papers in my appetite
 - Of course, the principal pursuit will get most of my attention and
   beginning to actively blog about it on my other blog: Datum2Nat
   
   
Really putting my polymathic aspirations out there with such a post:
now's the time to stay true to my word and not simply indulge in the
pseudo-rewards that ensue.
