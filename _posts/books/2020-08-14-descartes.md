My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3430303329">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The book's a slog. I like reading for fun. The book is good in its entirety but not meant to be a leisurely read. Neuroscience interests me, and emotion has been a notion that escapes my bounds of reason: as expected; hence this entry point. Could have chosen a friendlier alternative but worth it.
