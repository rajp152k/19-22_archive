My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3672090798">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
One morning, sipping coffee, gazing into infinity, it hit me that I'm 20: 20 years of me possessing a sense of existence, calling for a philosophical treatise on time; this book seemed like the right choice at first but was different than what I originally intended to revisit. However, It did turn out great as I leave with a good bird's eye view of the fairly present research with minimal effort.<br /><br />Being critical, one could say that the title is technically misleading as time could very well be similar to all the other dimensions once we have a unified theory and "time" machines(which could then be referred to as dimensional machines). <br /><br />The book, as expected, does a great job of underscoring your insignificance (not explicitly), but that's a prerequisite for all wannabe metaphysicists.
