I, hitherto, have been reading books as a single unit of intellectual
conveyance. However, that strategy doesn't work for all the
works. Some authors have their writings crisply intertwined with
their other writings. 

Approaching a single book as a part of a larger intellectual
conveyance is more efficient in the longer term if one intends to read
all the work of a particular author. Consequently, grouping these
reads together has also been somewhat interesting lately.

The first author that I'm reading adhering to this strategy is
Nietzsche. 
On the road to "Thus Spake Zarathustra", I've already read "Beyond
Good and Evil", "Twilight of the Idols", and presently consuming
"Human, all too Human". The next milestones will be "Genealogy of
Morals", "The Antichrist", "The Gay Science". Then I'll move on to
his reflective works: the "Ecce Homo" and the posthumous "The Will to
Power" (not exactly reflective, but will be using his notebooks to
derive reflective insights). Finally, all this will be put to use for
the better understanding of his "Thus Spake Zarathustra". Definitely
expecting to grasp him much better than if all this was consumed sparsely.
This is one reading cycle: will be revisiting the main works again
over the duration of my life.
