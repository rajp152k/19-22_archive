So ..., I'm finally done with my on-campus internship interviews and have more time to put into this stuff.

Overall, a great experience.  
 - I had 2 rounds after the screening test
 - both of them had some focus on mathematics:- pretty easy questions.
 - I also had an open ended question in the last round and that evolved into an interesting conversation.
 - We mostly talked in the context of machine learning
 - I got the offer in an short span of time after that...

So... yeah, am stoked to work with them in the summer of 21.
