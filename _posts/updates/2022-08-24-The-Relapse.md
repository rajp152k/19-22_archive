 - Done with the experiment 
 - Took a toll on all aspects of my life
 - Recovering slowly
 - cutting out all sorts of entertainment again
 - not writing the book
 - there's no point in writing a book
 - this blog is more than enough
 - getting regular with workouts again
 - sleep was messed up 
 - restoring my previous routine
 - won't be tweeting for quite some time now
   - except for any content that I've originally created 
   - includes this blog, youtube
   - poetry is dangerous and is a way to socially engineer yourself
     into thinking that you are wise
   - not going to be poetic henceforth
 - will only be writing on this blog
 - social media is too chaotic now and I have begun hating it again
 - time to maintain the connections that I have in real life
 - will only ever be creating content on social media and never
   consuming anything other than some creators that I know for sure
   are doing their research
 - instead, ramping up my reading efforts
 - One distraction that I've found good over the years is chess
 - will be investing some serious efforts into the same henceforth
 - giving up all sorts of entertainment
   - youtube
   - music (except when working out)
	 - cause there's already music in the gym and I'd rather listen to
       my own music than something that is not suited to me in the moment
   - fiction of any sorts
 - beginning to journal again and will not engage in any social events
   more than necessary
 - not going to buy any gaming console ever
 - will play team sports instead
 - time to introduce some good old fashioned boredom in my life again
 - too much fun is very dangerous
 - cutting out this objective indefinitely : will be focusing on work
   and rebuilding what I've lost over the past couple of months for
   some time now
