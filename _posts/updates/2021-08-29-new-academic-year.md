Haven't been updating lately and this post is an accumulation of some 
importants over that duration.


# Accepted Pre-placement Offer from Goldman Sachs

 - Will be joining GS as a quant/strat in the Controllers' Division
 - Bengaluru, at least for a couple of years, it is
 - So far so good in terms of how the internet portrays it

# New academic year

 - Into my 7th semester : only a year to go before I complete my
   Bachelors' ..
 - Do have certain long term goals on my mind going into this academic year
   - I usually plan long term on major life events that are specific
     to me : birthdays and new academic years
		- don't think I'll be mentally celebrating a lot of generic festivals
          in the future
		- Not the new christian year kind of planner
 - Thankfully, will be pursuing this one on campus and not virtually as
   for the last ~2.66 semesters
	- on that note ..

# Relocating

 - travelling from Nashik to Hyderabad today
   - posting this from Bombay airport while I wait to board the flight
	 - first time I'm blogging from some place other than my room
		 - a lot has changed during the quarantine..
	 - arrived quite early to avoid morning traffic
 - will be quarantined this week (5 days) and hence the gym won't be accessible
   - will be exploring some prisoner style workouts
	 - a lot of high-rep squats and pushups (mostly ballistic in nature)
	 - will also be trying some quasi-isometric variations to exploit
       time under tension
 - will be back with people my age and who think somewhat similarly
   at least in primal ways: expect my behavior to change to some
   extent as a whole
	   
# Information Diet

 - Have been re-establishing consumption boundaries and improving
   quality for the past few weeks
   - slackened post the internship to relax for a bit
   - will also be writing a lot more : on this blog and in my
     observational notebooks as well : will be building that shelf
     soon
 - For some time, I have been into the appeal of historic Indian
   scriptures and what wisdom they have to provide but have never
   found a good delivery route that is not a burden.
   - mostly because they have a Sanskrit component followed by an
     interpretation:
	 - I possibly cannot read that right without some initial effort 
		 - sounds highly paraphrased and some words do not have a
           transferable counterpart : natural languages are not quite
           translatable on the microscopic scale
	     - I did "Bhagavad Gita: A New Translation" by Stephen Mitchell
		 - Hindi is structurally and genetically much closer to Sanskrit than English
			 - reading Sanskrit in a roman script is visually
               displeasing as well
   - doing audio-books right now : much better
	 - Sanskrit -> Hindi for "Chanakya Neeti"
	 - don't even need to speed it up : sounds engaging as it is
       compared to its English counterparts
		- reading Latin-originated books
		- listening to Sanskrit-originated audio-books
