Most of my life, I've been an introvert (~19 years) - only in the past
2 years have I really started talking to people freely and verbalizing
the ways I judge them (am a generically rude person).  

Getting moderately fit, reading and writing a lot definitely does
help in articulating what I think with much more confidence: being a
natural weirdo helps with being meme material and getting infamous.  

I'm sort of infamous right now and while saying hi to so many people
throughout the day feels nice, I do miss the good old lonely days
filled with solitude -  I read and wrote all day.

Have a week to myself again (most of my friends out on vacation) and
I shall hibernate again, to return hungrier, to consolidate what I
learned in the last waking phase.
