Finally [ past the summer of 21 ]({% post_url
/updates/2020-09-12-gs_exp %}) and had my first corporate experience
with Goldman Sachs. Great one, did experience a fair amount of serendipity in
the latter half of my internship and was an intellectually rewarding
experience overall without turning into a slog.  

Took some time off after the internship. Commencing the
polymathic pursuits that were on hold; speeding up the updates on the
blog like they were prior to the internship; looking forward to
progressing in several aspects the coming academic year having some
fun while I'm at it.
