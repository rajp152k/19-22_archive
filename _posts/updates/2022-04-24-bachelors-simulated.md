### [2022-04-24 Sun 16:08] - 8028

I'll be done with my lectures by the 2nd of May 2022.  
I will say that I've changed the most, as a person, in the last four
years of my life.   

Only one week remains until I leave my dorm for good and head back to
Nashik.   

I wish to finish my stay in IITH on a high - an honest high. I will be
doing activities that really contributed the most to my growth over
the past four years.  

These would be:

#### Reading

 - the major credit of whatever I can write about today goes to my
   pursuit of reading diversely and for the sake of itself
 - I will read a lot in the coming week

#### Writing

 - will be ramping up the amount I write for the coming week
 - want to get out as much intellectual residue that I possess right
   now
 - I experience an intellectual influx of a novel nature depending on
   where I am.
 - this week, I wish to capture the lifestyle that led to what I am 
 
#### Studying
 
 - this was always a priority and I wish to end things right
 - have been slacking off recently due to obvious reasons..
 - realistically planning to deal with this in the most efficient and
   enjoyable manner possible for the last week of IITH
 - I enjoy studying and I wish to end my bachelors studying - intensely.
 
#### Lifting

 - the gym is my favorite place
 - I am a naturally aggressive human and weights allow me to channel
   that anger when things do not turn out to be as expected
 - the experience of grinding during a lift is incomparable and
   invaluable
 
#### Running

 - I've discovered running only lately and I'm smitten
 - It again is an incomparable and invaluable experience
 - it's about lingering around your physical and mental thresholds, toying
   with them, breaking through them
 - I run twice a week and will continue to do so
 
#### Conversations

 - I am a very good conversationalist
 - I like good conversations
 - I plan to have a lot of good conversations with a lot of friends this week
 
#### Night Walks
 
 - this is my preferred form of meditation
 - I am not very good at the
   sitting-still version, yet..
 - this is also the form of solitude I enjoy the most
 - I shall feel the breeze again
 
#### YouTube

 - this is a relatively new pursuit and one that I'm enjoying
 - expressing your ideas visually is an orthogonal pursuit to writing
 - will be doing both: for they complement each other 

#### Journaling

 - this is the original pursuit that led to the other pursuits I
   mention above
 - If I were to personify my pursuits, journaling is the wisest elder
   of the family
 - doesn't show off the wisdom and is extremely grounded
 - will not direct you to the answer explicitly but drop ingenious
   hints via a series of intricate questions
 - I shall pay my respects to this pursuit again for the next week
 - it doesn't care for the facade that the world puts on and is the
   most honest of all the other pursuits
 - I shall lift my pencil, sharpener and notebook again.

### The True High

The majority of what I am, I attribute to these pursuits. Many of my
friends ask me the reason that I choose not to smoke, drink or indulge
in other such activities and to them I say:

> I'm always High.  

These pursuits keep me excited about life and I do not wish to escape
what's around - I, instead, desire digging deep into the rabbit hole.
