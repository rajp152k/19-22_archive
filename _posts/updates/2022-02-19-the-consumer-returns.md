I deleted all my major social media accounts circa April 18 2021 because I found them to
be a waste of time.
Since, I've found my life to be relatively more peaceful and noise-free.
Since, I've been able to write a lot more without being influenced
by several externalities that I was exposed to previously. 
Since, the blog's readership has grown to be quite stable with a lot of
 users returning frequently.  
 
My writing style has evolved to be somewhat of a stream of bursts
every once in a while instead of large independent posts. I like
imposing that temporal dynamicity on my streams and recording my thoughts
over a time instead of a snapshot of my understanding in the moment.   

Consequently, RSS (really simple syndication) cannot do the job as I
frequently append updates on the same post, dispersed in several
corners of the blog.  

Feel like I've been making it difficult (although implicitly) to keep
up with the updates. I don't like the reader being burdened with the efforts
to navigate to those corners.

Hence, henceforth, I'll be posting update locations on twitter.
