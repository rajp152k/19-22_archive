Don't google that - this is the first recorded use of ..

#### GNOMENPHOMANIA (noun):

> The unnecessary urge to name novel abstractions  

	- etymology: gnosis + nomen + ...
	- nō-mən-fə-ˈmā-nē-ə
	- One's proneness for the same increases with 
	  increasing desire to sound extremely unfamiliar
    - eg: That wannabe-esotericist is such a gnomenphomaniac
	
Over the past few years, reading fairly diversely, I've had a few
realizations regarding the evolution of, and the nature of
nomenclature pertaining to a domain.  

For new domains that do not stand on the shoulders of existing
domains, the joy of coining most of the jargon is enjoyed by
the founders.  

If you happen to read the founders' literature as your introduction
to the subject - you'll have a good time as they build the subject
from scratch and would naturally accept the development of the domain.  

However, if a modernized introduction does not take care to retain the
developmental thoughts of the founder - the abstractions that the
domain introduces do not come that easy. I, at least, tend to be
resistant to accepting and remembering the abstraction. It's just a
name for me. Consequently, the style of books I prefer introduce the
abstraction with previously known abstractions only later dropping the
"called" bomb - almost as if it was inconsequential.  

Undigressing[^1], I've grown immune to the effect of seeing a
previously unseen word - it is truly just a place holder for an
abstraction - no more and no less.  

I happen to chance upon abstractions of phrasal/sentencial/paragraphal (these words
don't exist, yet) extent extremely frequently and do
definitely enjoy having my own way with my words.  

Consolidating, I'm a gnomenphomaniac and that explains my fascination
with crafting novel words.  

This is exactly how I intend to proceed with the theory of agnostic
perspectivism: to be so ludicrously verbose when stating an
abstraction that the reader is forced to grasp the abstraction
instead of simply parting with the word.
