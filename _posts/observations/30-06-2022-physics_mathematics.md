In my pursuit to create my own theories, I have lost touch with
reality.  

Now, inventing new stuff is cool and fun but it comes at a dangerous
cost.  
To not be relatable with any one. In my conclusion of not trusting any
and all leaps of faith. I have taken huge leaps in a very unaware
manner.  

The bill comes due.  
Giving up music indefinitely. It is the greatest social engineering
trick there is.  
Will not be delving into music theory henceforth. Even though it
allowed me to solve the core issue pertaining to education, it also
messed with my analytical abilities and that to follow concrete rules
when required.  
It handicaps you. Music, fiction, imagination have turned me into what
I started out hating : someone who escapes reality for the sake of
fulfilling my own desires.  

I am ditching music for good. Not even going to use it for
focusing. The noise around me is enough. Using music is allowing an
external entity to reprogram your brain via risky means.  

I will be learning how to get used to the music around me. Music is
noise for me henceforth. Ditching the headphones for good.  

Physics is what I like and that led me to symbolic algebra. Ascribing
a meaning to any and every beat that occurs in a track is what has
taken away my ability to interpret numbers just as they are, in their
functional sense. A zero is not just a zero anymore.  

The zero is a very common symbol that connects a lot of domains and
connecting them is risky business. Using music has taken a toll on
me. No more leaps of faith. Will be working with what I'm given to
work with.  

These are the "blades of chaos" that kratos regrets using. For they
were tools of unaware destruction.  Never worth it, irrespective of
the amount of problems you solve. They were never yours to start with.
I choose to forget the symbolic value of zero for now. My sanity is
much more important than all the "power" I perceivably receive. Music,
used in any manner, creates great weaknesses.  

I have to spend some time regaining my focus. Back to
journalling. Symbolic algebra is one thing and seeing the same pattern
everywhere is a completely different ball game. You risk insanity.  

Back to using journals and words as my primary form of communication
with anyone.   

Photos, music, gestures is something we probably will never truly
understand completely and I choose to refrain from using them.  

This is the warning that Dr. Strange talks about should come before
that of the spells.  

Experimentation is the spirit of science and faith is an instrument
for future hurt. Unaware faith is not completely someones fault but it
still is an epistemological crime.   

Returning to living in the boring present I choose to live in.  

Will learn how to defend myself against music now.

Bruce Wayne is still the smartest and studying more is the way to go -
Do not trust anyone - is why he concludes so.  



Just Raj.  
Not interested in my roots anymore, look forward to the future.  
This is just an opinion and you are free to interpret your present 
via your own symbols.  
I'm simply the messenger.  

I'm done playing thanos and now I shall get back to playing peter
parker. The curse of knowledge has been lifted for me though. Just
note that it does take a tool on your mind.  

That is why I choose the blue pill, the rabit hole doesn't go deep, it
instead goes in circles. Escaping that circle is what enlightenment is
about(I think).  

Archiving this blog.  
It has served its purpose.  

Now I will continue writing for myself and not for everyone out there.  
This is why explaining your actions is very important, ignorance is
not bliss. You're only inviting future hurt by leveraging unnecessary leaps of faith.
