### Incentive 

All my life, I have never witnessed a subject in the making. Whatever
domain I was intrigued had a significant amount of literature already
published for new entrants.

Around ~2 years ago, I read Leonardo's biography and I was infatuated
by the idea of pushing the primal boundaries of a subject - research today,
conventionally speaking, is too specific to be primal.

Now, given my epistemological interests, I would like to experience
the growth of an immature subject without explicitly needing any
heavy machinery.

### My Primal Closure

Proceeding to formalize my thoughts:

I would classify a subject as primal if one can reach its boundaries without
any complicated instruments. Further, I would classify primal
instruments as the sensory organs, one's own brain, and observations
(entities, their behaviors and their attributes) that are consequent upon these core
primals. Collectively addressing this as my primal closure.
For a tool to be usable in the propagation of the subject,
it should be conceptually accessible with these primal tools with the
theory that the subject provides.

Clarifying with an instance: The observation that when I press the tip
of a pencil against a paper, I can see new marks on the paper is in my
primal closure but the observation that I know that pencils are made
by wood, graphite, lead going through some non-trivial process is not
within my primal closure. A pencil is easily available in my habitat
and this association of a pencil and its canonically observable
behaviors would be "natural" for me.

Do note, however, that all subjects degenerate into
primal ones as one can first develop the complicated instrument
with simpler "natural" ones and proceed normally. 

Pertaining to my present need, the starting point of many subjects is a
non-trivial dogma. Hence, I would have to play catch-up for a long
time before I actually get to the crux of the subject. 

For instance, to study geometrical optics, I would have to first
get into how light traverses in different media (I know that it slows
down in glass but not exactly why so). It doesn't seem so
obvious with my primal closure and would have to take a big detour
before I actually get into geometrical optics.

As a good rule of thumb - any subject that has a pragmatic name,
probably has its primal aspects neatly abstracted away already, and hence a
respectable amount of literature to influence new entrants and
requiring correspondingly larger detours to get started with the subject.

### Pragmatics

As of now, I could identify two ways to go about it:
 - independently pursue an already established subject without
   explicitly seeking inputs other than my primal closure
 - invent a subject
 
A caveat with such a pursuit is that if I choose to go with an already
established subject, I'd be reinventing the wheel and progress
wouldn't be optimal: Its not a far-fetched hypothesis that I'd be
better (questionable) by reading up on the subject.
 
I also don't want to waste my time with some unnecessarily esoteric subject.
I was, again, inspired by Leonardo's codices: the way he so easily
could sketch out intricate ideas on paper - I would like to be so
fluid with my thoughts on notebook without being bothered by the
technical nuances of doing so. The way one does that is exactly by
completely tackling those technical nuances and incorporating them as
second nature. So drawing was a natural choice.

I started out a week ago by trying exactly point out what made things
to seem like exactly those things: what exactly makes a cup of tea
(note that this notation is heavily overloaded and saying "cup of tea"
already fires up a lot of intractable thoughts in one's brain that my
primal closure, without ignorance, cannot reach) seem to me a like a cup
of tea. I messed around with shadows a bit and how they affect depth
perception (everyone knows they do but only some get into the
details). I spent a day of observing how light interacts with objects
around me, how I perceive patterns, how different factors affect what
I see.

One would quickly realize that drawing, however, would cater only to
one's vision and I'd be cutting my potential short if I constrict
myself to the same.

### Culmination

I was going to name my pursuits in the expansion of my primal closure
as "Observation Theory". Albeit not heavily used, this name is
still slightly overloaded and new entrants would approach this subject
with some mental baggage.

Therefore, I chose ..

## The Theory of Agnostic Perspectivism 

Note that I do not intend to use "Agnostic" in the theological sense.
Instead etymologically: Agnostic (from Ancient Greek ἀ- (a-) 'without', and γνῶσις (gnōsis) 'knowledge').

Now, Perspectivism is, as Wikipedia says ... 

> .. the epistemological principle that perception of and knowledge of something are always bound to the interpretive perspectives of those observing it.

Hence, this is supposed to be a personalized take on observations,
without the explicit influence of prior knowledge.

Now that I finally have the joy of inventing a legitimate subject, I'm
enthusiastic to see how it evolves over the years.

This is my first, self-incentivized, pragmatic, aware, epistemological
pursuit. Feels much better than reading up on it.
