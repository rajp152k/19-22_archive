Temporality is an inherent part of any primal observation (check
primal closure from the "Theory of Agnostic Perspectivism"). 

I reach this conclusion via my augmented closure [^1]: societally
well-established knowledge can be used as black-boxes over the primal closure.

Note that - given I've already spent ~20 years without awareness of
the notion of a primal closure, thinking that the only major
epistemological extension one goes through is via their augmented
closure - old habits die hard. 

Something is only ever static if one analyses it on a higher, abstractualized [^2] level.

Recollecting what the senses actually sense:
 - neurons can sense pressure: consequence of interatomic forces, which
   exist above absolute zero
 - darkness is a consequence of our lack
   of sensitivity for low intensities and frequencies out of the
   visible domain (one always emits and observes heat above absolute zero)
 - matter always vibrates above absolute zero; silence is again a
   consequence of our lack of sensitivity for lower and higher frequencies
 - the sense of taste and smell, though superficially chemical, can be
   ultimately reduced to physics, and the concerned neurons can be
   consequently subjected to molecular reactions (hence atomic forces)
   
Note that, as a side note, this does somewhat enforce the hypothesis
that time stops at absolute zero
   
Hence, the idea of an instantaneous observation does not make
sense. Any static appearances are exactly that - only appearances:
 - a seemingly static light bulb that seems to be consistently bright,
   is simply fluttering at very high frequencies, beyond the
   human eye's sensitivity
 - when pressing you palm against a wall, the neurons consistently
   fire and recharge to fire again at the same intensity: it's only
   your brain's different treatment (possible entry point to the notion of
   attention) of the same rapid fires that makes you forget that
   you've been sitting on a chair for some time: the interatomic
   forces always exist and are dynamic in nature

Hence, I would hypothesize
 - the word static(the way humans intuitively understand it) actually
   only refers  to the non-changing nature of a rate of change of some
   entity and not that of the entity itself
 - there is no static equilibrium on the atomic level - only dynamic
   equilibrium exists 
 - the word static is essentially is a perceptual black box that
   humans use to mask the coarseness in their observational sensitivity
   

I write this article after spending a week observing and recollecting
 my old augmented closure, regarding how we sense things temporally
