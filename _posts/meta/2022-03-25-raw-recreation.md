All the major revelations I have or decisions that I make are usually
conscient[^1] re-assertions of previously subconscient realizations.  

I only formulate them fully later on within conversations or when I'm
writing.  

If you happen to have checked [the disclaimer]({% link
_pages/disclaimer.md %}) 
(which turned out to be sort of a pledge as to along what lines and
intentions will I approach my writing pursuits), you may have noticed
that I do have a focus on generating raw observations, irrespective of
their correctness, based on how they seem in the moment.  

I you also [happen to have noticed]({% post_url
/updates/2022-02-19-the-consumer-returns %}) that I quit social media as a
consumer circa April 2021, and have returned only recently as a
creator, and that I view this as a stepping stone towards learning to
formulate my thoughts better, you already have a fair idea of where
I'm going with this post.  

Recently, [my girlfriend broke up with me]({% post_url
/meta/2022-03-21-an-end %}) and she used to listened to a lot of these ideas
of mine a lot and also acted as a humanoid notebook of sorts that can
sustain a good conversation and think along with you. If there's one
thing that I've learned from all those conversations : it's
better articulating myself and doing so accurately because a lot of
what we talked about was extremely abstractualized[^2] and we frequently
concluded with conclusions that would seem highly inorganic to an
external observer but honestly resulted by the virtue of
conversational flow.  

I now have this excess of sources of ideas and a scarcity of their
sinks. Writing alone is not enough for me. I do talk different than
I write and learning to express myself verbally is another orthogonal
pursuit of mine (rhetoric - one of the three ancient arts of discourse
(along with grammar and logic)).  

Hence, I've decided to create a Youtube channel, where I simply
 converse. I won't be leveraging other media and will be focusing on
trying to make it look like a conversation with myself - being honest,
not caring about correctness in the moment, but of course willing to
correct myself if I find out that I've incorrectly interpreted an
abstraction. As previously mentioned, the writing pursuit is
still independent and indispensable.  

While writing this post, I have realized that, the hitherto
subconscient[^2] reason that I do not use pictures in my blogs is that
I'd rather prefer writing a thousand words and still being
misunderstood about what's on my mind (that's what I'm learning here:
conveying what's on my mind) than to simply post a picture.  

Consequently, even on my Youtube channel, I will keep things organic
and not use any conventional tricks of the trade - It is simply going
to be me talking to a camera in a room. I don't wish to be a
vlogger and use what's exciting around me to assist my expressive
pursuits, but to simulate exactly how a conversation with me would
evolve if we met at a library and I don't have the permission to pull
out my phone to show you stuff. I'm ditching the training wheels...  

This shall be a raw recreation of my experiences.

[^1]: this is not exactly a neologism: I've been itching to use it for some time now in my blogs but usually don't cause it has a contemporary - conscious. Conscient is an obsolete latin lexical end  but I still wish to revive it in my blogs. I found out it's obsolete after I typed it in my editor and the red squigglies popped up... hence,  a pseudoneologism it shall be. Funny how markdown doesn't allow recursive footnotes because pseudoneologism is a neologism.

[^2]: an already initialized neologism (AAIN) : "AAIN" is AAIN
