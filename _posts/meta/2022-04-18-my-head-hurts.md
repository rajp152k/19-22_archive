I'm in a point of my life where I have a huge in-flux of abstractions
coupled with a lack of out-flux of these very abstractions.   
I know I've talked about pacing myself and maintaining separate identities
in my blogs and videos but I'm unable to do so currently.  

I've only recently begun figuring out what I really like doing and
along with that thought, my mind is running through several
possibilities without control. I do not use any synthetic numbing
agents and do not wish to do so anytime soon.  
My mind races uncontrollably, like a raging bull, lacking control and
discipline.  
I can't sleep when I want to, can't stop working when I
want to, can't stop thinking when I want to, can't figure out what is
the cause of this - I can't stop ...  

Writing has been grounding me recently and helps me be honest with
myself, observing myself from a level higher and allowing me to
let off a little of this humongous amount of steam my head has right
now.  


My head hurts, and I'm not sure whether:
 - it'll explode first due to the excess internal abstractual[^1] pressure or..
 - it'll implode first due to accumulating a large amount of abstractual[^1] matter: all of it collapsing into itself due to the formation of a meta-physical singularity.
 
 
Finally, I embrace this hurt and won't be escaping it in any
inorganic way.  
I feel like that teenage superhero
that doesn't have a hold on his powers. I'm at the cross-roads between 
degenerating into an abstractual[^1] chaotic volcano or regroup and
abstractually[^1] morph into an ordered, self-sustaining ecosystem on
a big, peaceful, green mountain.  

I will be writing more, and posting more videos to maintain my sanity.  

This is good and I'm looking forward to the challenge; I shall smirk
through it.
