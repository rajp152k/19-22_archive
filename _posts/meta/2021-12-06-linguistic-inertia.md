I frequently converse in three languages: Hindi, English and
Marathi - all with distinct sets of acquaintances. Likewise, every
person has a preferred communication language with every other human
they are acquainted to. 

Occasionally, two of my acquaintances meet and have a different
preferred language. If I'm not acquainted to that language, all's
usual. But if I am acquainted to that language and they are aware of
that: they might request me to converse in that
language. 

This usually happens for all three possible pairs of Hindi, Marathi
and English. 

What happens next is fairly awkward: I'm stuck between two modes of
communication and stutter for a good half minute with a
jaw-dropped (my first aware use of a passive adjective) smile of
embarrassment.

Hence, have been explicitly forcing myself to converse in different
languages with the same acquaintance and switch fairly smoothly, for a
few days.

Now I switch easily.
