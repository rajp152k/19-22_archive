I encounter a lot of exciting tools one could benefit knowing about, skills that would be fun to master and new fields that are interesting.
Some of them are worth it, some are not.  
An active log over time helps place things in context and evaluate ones that worth pursuing given my condition.

This is an active queue annotating the entities w.r.t their current progress.By this I hope to:
    - increase awareness about what I currently have on my plate and if there is room for more
    - not forget things that I once found to be interesting and simply did not follow up on
    - filter out a specks that would not be of any use in the close future
	- Is that entity just a new candy I happen to want which will only make me fat and sloppy.
    - incorporate the much needed discipline concerning my attitude towards novel things that I lack right now

### Latin
 
     - have been thinking about this for long
     - interested in etymologies, so a natural choice
     - following the series by Hans Oberg : Lingua Latina

### One Arm Pushups

    - max rep count for a normal pushup last I tested it was around 40
	- this seems more of a skill of practice and neural activation than sheer strength
	- success would be rewarding : no idea of the expected timeline: going to research a little and get on with the fitness logs

### Speed Reading

[Speed Reading Logs]({% post_url /meta/2021-04-10-speed-reading-logs %}){: .btn .btn--inverse}

### Elisp

    - will migrate from zsh to eshell sometime soon : rash (racket) seems like a viable option as well
    - living on a Lisp machine all day sounds nice 
	
### Lucid Dreaming

### C++

    - This is a hobby : don't explicitly need it for work/academics
    - I did explore this fairly well the last summer : one of those things that I hope to master
    - want to get deeper this summer: might look into some derivatives trading with C++ given my upcoming internship with Goldman Sachs
    - Plus this also helps going high and staying low at the same time : might get into embedded programming sometime soon
    - Will learn this after I am fairly competent with Lisp though : going to be intense

### Assembly Programming

    - gotta get low
    - my first post on this blog was about WASM
	- will soon explore its interop with C++
	
### Pistol Squats

	- tried them before but experienced some knee pain
	- gotta research a little and gonna get back at it

| Double Unders | IN   | Fri May 14 17:58:23 IST 2021 |

### Emacs

     - Migration was intense : learning has been daemonized for now
       - expecting and experiencing major dividends already
     - going all the way and also learning Elisp
     
### Double Unders

	- Can do two consecutively with a 1 pound rope 
		- relatively easy to progress from now onwards

    - can do three balls
    - could pick them up sometime again

| Peeling eggs | IN   | Thu May  6 21:43:03 IST 2021 |

### Peeling eggs

    - Now I eat 12 a day , started with 4
    - around an average of 8 a day for 2 years : atleast 6000 eggs peeled
    - Could make a living out of this I guess
