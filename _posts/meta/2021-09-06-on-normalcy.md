Post a 5-day quarantine period, I'm back at my old dorm room. Getting
back in a community of somewhat like-minded humans with diversified
tastes feels good. One does get jealous, in a healthy manner, listening to the varied
endeavors ones' colleagues partake in. It does make you question your
acceptance of the self-imposed fact that "You are doing
enough". Productivity levels rise as you can actively observe others
around you investing into the grind, while relaxation settles down
with a new connotation : conversations when we dine and snack.
These are things I did before a screen for a long time. Given the kind
of person I am, I can soon see myself getting accustomed to this as
well and complaining about how I can be more efficient. Sounds nice to
be apparently aware of the future..

My batch(18-22) spent a good ~1.5 years of our life, that were meant to be
spent away from parents, with our parents. Video calls, chats and any
other media can only go so far in terms of being conducive of an
organic conversation. Now that we are together, all the "water-cooler" conversations
taken for granted before and shunned for the sake of efficiency,
perceivably, seem to be doing the opposite : they seem to lead to deeper conversations
and to the exchange of high-level ideas that one does not get by
researching themselves. 

Your friends, when conversing about a thing
they've explored, do so in hindsight : and one is lead there
organically, with insignificant active "nudgement". Sure you can get
into podcasts for "organicity" but the ability to participate, and
interrupt, and question right away is priceless.

Still adapting to the new old normal again with some awareness...
Writing first thing in the morning as the university gym opens at 0600
and my circadian rhythms are still tuned to 0450. Not sure if
intellectual pre-workouts are effective, will find out..
