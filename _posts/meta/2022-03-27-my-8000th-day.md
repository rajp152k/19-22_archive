### [2022-03-27 Sun 21:59] - 8000

Today is my 8000th day and anyone who knows me truly well, would wish me
with more enthusiasm today than on my birthday.
As of right now, that would be no one. Acquaintances wish me on my
birthday.  

I account for blocks of 100 days as to what I wish to check-off  off
of my long-term todo list for that block; but I truly celebrate after blocks of 1000 days.  

I start every 100 day block with a 3 day water fast (do consume salt
 (electrolytes)); had lunch today afternoon, will have lunch again this
 Wednesday afternoon; Will continue lifting weights as usual.   
 
Fasting is amazing: helps me plan the coming block smartly.
