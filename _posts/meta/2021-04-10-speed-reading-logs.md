Stream for speed reading stats ( speed, comments on comprehension and qualitative updates )

## INIT : Sat Apr 10 10:16:32 IST 2021 (PINNED)

 - initialized speed reading logs
 - following "Breakthrough Rapid Reading" by Peter Kump
 - practicing daily from 18:00 to 18:45, logging the details from 18:45 onwards
 - evaluation metrics :
   1. WPM : words per min
   2. RI : Retention index (fraction of major ideas retained - subjective)
      - REVISED TO AN INDICATOR VARIABLE DUE TO EXTENT OF AMBIGUITY
      - from 7th of MAY 2021
      - REFILED as : RECALL ATTEMPT INDICATOR
	- indicates whether that run was recall oriented
	- *'ed flags indicated a more reliable test : recall being the prime intention
	

## Closure

 - efforts fizzled out during the 6th week of training
 - I speed read the last week of the book
 - not the glorious end the book deserves but respectful enough that I
   stuck with it for 85% along the way
 - this thread's been hanging unattended for a while now
   - deserves a closure for all the religiously invested effort
   - not a waste, worth it.
   - final review posted [here]({% post_url /meta/2021-06-19-Speed-reading-closure %})

## Practice Logs
### Wed Jun  2 09:49:40 IST 2021

 - speeding up recall oriented hand-movements (personal goal)
   - underlining : 1648.4 -> 1848.0 wpm across the session
   - on new material : with the intention of recall (did not actually
     recall)
 - The author stated the importance of recall; says:
   - speed reading + recall > reading for all that time
 - Personal updates : 
   - focusing when reading is extremely easy
   - longest reading session of 3 hours a week ago on moderately
     complex material(non-fiction)
   - Even for absolutely complex material (philosophy, academic reads
     (machine learning), manuals)
		- albeit lower speeds, effortless focus and quickly get what I
          want according to the preset purpose, rather than drifting
          off tangents
   - Major Update : 
	 - overcome the imposter syndrome associated with speed reading: 
		 - "Are you really reading?"
		 - "Do you even remember that 27th word on the 7th paragraph
           of the 3rd chapter of that edition of that particular
           book?"
		   - Bootstrapping knowledge and meaningfully reiterating is
             much more fun rather than bull-dozing head first from
             start to finish.
	 - Reading is a much more active activity pursuit than before
   - Speed is not the only thing that this book helps with.
	 
### Mon May  31 13:50:02 IST 2021 

 - returning to the drills after an unwanted break again
 - on towards the week 5 drills
 - have been practicing with comprehension with my usual readings
   during the break
 - One paragraph structuring drill (hierarchize from the third
   sentence) lasting for 15 mins
 - one hand-movement practicing drills for 20 mins:
   - underlining, dusting, slashing, criss-cross 
   - purpose : visual reading : final clocked rate : 3633.2 wpm with
     cumulative recall over all these hand movements
   - Cause of high speeds : visual reading on known material

### Tue May 18 19:35:26 IST 2021

 - second practice session the day (20 mins) : Latin has been put on hold until I'm done with this book
 - Author now talks about matching different types of reading to different purposes (note that these definitions are opionated as confessed by the author):
   - linear reading : difficult material
   - skimming : get the gist and cache a  mental index of the text : focus on the provided structure to the text (headings et cetera)
	 - only to quickly retrieve addresses later on once the purpose is clarified
   - scanning : close to visual reading : already have a purpose : hunt for something 
   - visual reading : words are pictures : read in circles or in reverse or as if it's mandarin(top-down)
	 - when you know a lot about what you are reading (fairly common) and just want to fill in gaps of knowledge with new details 
	 - or : bootstrapping knowledge (quicker and more granulated skimming (skimming on steroids gone rogue))
		 - I've begun dreaming about parentheses

### Tue May 18 16:15:35 IST 2021

 - The mid book test today : a highly recall oriented speed reading session : this is the true growth compared to my initial baseline recorded on 12th Apr.
 - The test was about reading as much as you can for 3 mins and then spending another 6 mins for jotting down the prominences of what you could recollect.
   - satisfied with the performance : 18 pages in 3 mins @ 1628 wpm with a good amount of recall
 - Also started with the week 4 drills and content
 - Author slowly brings in the idea of reading with high recall in complicated and abstract texts : think philosophy.
   - says rates won't be as high as the superficial stuff but would grow proportionately along with the ceiling : have been experiencing that in my daily reads.
 - Also introduces the notion of visual reading while anticipating what is to come next : analogy of a musician (reads notes before playing them)
   - Involves looking out for certain pivotal phrases/words that indicate the nature of the following prose.
 - finished off with a tagging drill where one has to categorize the third sentence in a hierarchical mannner compared to the first and second sentence of the paragraph
   - randomly picked paragraphs and goes on for 6 mins
   - was the first time : could do only 14 today : comparitively more involved than the other drills

### Mon May 17 17:01:18 IST 2021

 - End of week 3 drills, and halfway through the course
 - one recall oriented normal reading session (10 pages in 1.5 mins) clocking in @ 2147 wpm
 - new paragraphing movement introduced to encourage visual cues instead of relying on sub-vocalization
   - along with circling, this aids the brain adapt to consume a group of words as a picture rather than a sequence.
   - is effective and after the initial drill : employing this in regular reads was second nature ...
 - Tomorrow : the mid-book test

### Sun May 16 20:11:58 IST 2021

 - Took a break from the book for a while 
 - was practicing with my daily reading quota itself: the drills have been transferring pretty smoothly
 - as of right now I'm reading a lot of manuals, papers, and a biography : practical speed has definitely improved
 - Today, the author hinted at practicing for speed with comprehension with some children's books.
   - For me, that boils down to some new-age self-help claiming a quick fix for possibly philosophical issues
   - am surprised : didn't expect the practical reading off-time to show up as results in the drills
	   - One recall-oriented drill clocked in @ 2437 wpm
	 - pretty satisfied with today's recall as well
 - Noticing progress; getting back on track and finishing this off

### Fri May  7 20:47:31 IST 2021 

 - gotta pickup the habit before I lose it again (this is my second attempt with the book)
 - one recall oriented drill clocked in @ 1367 wpm
 - might double down on the sessions to get this over with quickly : 30 min sessions - twice a day

### Fri Apr 30 19:45:12 IST 2021

 - an assortment of mechanical tips were introduced today 
	- dusting movement introduced
	- how to relax a (paperback) book : useful
	- how to turn a page
 - done with set of drills for week 2, progressing to week 3
   - took me 18 days : fair enough
 - 1 practice session@1612 wpm sans RI 
 - need to keep on pushing through
    - does get boring at times

### Wed Apr 28 21:08:03 IST 2021

 - Amping up the difficulty of the practice material
 - picked up some abbreviation heavy management textbooks from my Dad's old MBA stack
 - 1 final speed drill@1372wpm and RI (0.60)
   - RI is not a very good metric
   - rely on subjective analysis
 - Did scan the upcoming chapters of the book and they seem practical
   - this is not a magic trick
   - some disciplined practice is what it takes : that is good.

### Tue Apr 27 20:18:19 IST 2021
 
 - setting up the meta-base for future comprehension drills
   - one representative run @1958 wpm without RI
   - one para-hunting session @ 22 paras
 - speed drills getting a little more enjoyable
 - fairly strong habit by now but still need to choose to get drilling
   - need to learn how to daemonize these skills without much lack of awareness

### Mon Apr 26 21:01:37 IST 2021

 - comprehension drills: using recall
 - no speed runs
 - new recall strategy being employed : referred as "The Magic Line" by the author
 - new para-hunting drills employed : figure out the gist of as many randomly selected paragraphs in 5 mins
   - introducing new log in Progress : 15 today

### Fri Apr 23 20:08:04 IST 2021

 - practiced maintaining high speed on new material and in a normal reading environment

### Tue Apr 20 19:18:01 IST 2021

 - Comprehension on a steady rise
 - current evaluation is very lenient but somewhat uniform
    - how does one fixate on a particular level of astuteness consistently?
 - 1 drilling session resulting in 1 min read @ 1240wpm and one discourse about having a purpose when reading
    - the more clearly defined the purpose, the better
    - key is to match the correct technique with the material depending on the purpose

### Sun Apr 18 19:33:08 IST 2021

 - Comprehension drills incorporated today:
    - involves varying speed corresponding to the structure of the text
    - mostly shifting modes of confirmation of knowns and scanning new information
    - more fun than the usual speed drilling : 
        - enhances reading as a non-linear process and is easier to focus through out
            - compared to a consistent effort of maintaining speed and inferring things at the same time
    - Retention index incorporated back and things are getting exciting
    - as expected, the speed dropped but the improvement is going to be cyclic and decoupled so that's all well

### Thu Apr 15 20:00:42 IST 2021

 - drilling time : learning to move fast : RI is out of the picture right now
 - lot of drills and one representative run of 1 min @ 1311 wpm
 - seems odd and feel like a cheat but the author reinstates that drilling should be specific to either speed or comprehension
 - also trying to minimize sub-vocalization and instead start seeing words : building an instantaneous context about a prominent word/phrase in the locality

### Wed Apr 14 18:47:41 IST 2021

 - focusing on eliminating regressions and getting used to the right hand as a pacer
 - still not focusing on retention index yet: that has of course taken a temporary hit 
     - but the key is to drill these two aspects orthogonally
 - also tried reducing the number of saccades by trying to increase the number of words left out in the beginning and the end of the line
    - this is particularly difficult : have a habit of reading all words
    - occasionally, slips do occur and reinforcing form from the next line is what it'll take to forge the new habit
 - larger drill session today : four three minute untested runs on the same material to encourage carelessness and practice speed
    - final tested run on new material for three minutes @ 827 wpm, RI not applicable
 

### Tue Apr 13 18:50:03 IST 2021

 - no comprehension evals today : hence RI wasn't Applicable
 - two runs: 707 and 673 wpm
    - using harmonic mean as representative wpm : 689.58
    - these are rates and arithmetic mean is not appropriate
    - will similarly be using geometric mean for retention index in the future
        - as it's a ratio
 - using right hand index finger as pacer
    - helps eliminate regressions
    - author encourages to do this everywhere while picking up the skill
        - seems inconvenient given the book is old
 - not focusing on retention index today

### Mon Apr 12 18:29:03 IST 2021

 - gauging baseline, no specific techniques employed
 - Baseline Eval:
     1. WPM     : 366 wpm
     2. RI      : 0.5
