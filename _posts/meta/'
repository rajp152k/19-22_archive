### [2022-04-25 Mon 11:58] - 8029

In a lot of my videos, I talk about:
 - getting my hands dirty in the physical world and not escaping away into the Himalayas to meditate.
 - being able to manage my senses right in the middle of the chaotic
   world around and being aware of it, while you're traversing through it.
 - <some other crude metaphor you'd like: three of a thing look good>
   
It's been a year since I deleted my original social media accounts
and began blogging, only recently adding YouTube and twitter to better
index the content.  

Today morning, I realized that I have been keeping my distance
from the cyber- world when it comes to social media. The initial
reasons I collated for this stance were:
 - it's a waste of time
 - there's a lot of fake content

These still hold true.  
Anyway, I am acting as a cyber-ascetic right
now and that is hypocrisy. I have expressed that I consider the
physical counterpart of this to be escapism and that is not a fair
treatment of that line of thought.  

I would perhaps tag that as an indefinite exile - to cultivate your
own style of awareness. Note that I say indefinite, not infinite. It
definitely can't be a predetermined finite exile because that
inherently implies that you plan on returning. You plan on getting
your hands dirty again even before you've washing them, observing
their morphology when they're clean, with an unbiased perspective,
separating form from function.  

I now have this new-found respect for ascetics and finally don't
harshly judge their actions. They don't need to be intellectually liable to
reason their actions with me, or anyone for that matter. I can attest
to the same due to the experience I have from my indefinite
cyber-exile.  

Contextualizing the decision I took a year ago, this is the entry
picked up from the Marco (my homepage).[^1]

    - have quit social media(deleted accounts : facebook and instagram)
        - had already been off the platforms for a couple of months so this isn't cold-turkey
        - this did put a smile on my face : unexpected energy surge immediately after the deletion
        - ofcourse, other more active forms of leisure are being incorporated
    - also quit television and all other forms of visual entertainment (2 days in now)
        - this is cold turkey
        - plan to stick to this for a long time but hard rules are good to avoid loopholes and gray areas
            - no visual entertainment for 30 days : that's pretty simple
                - followed by one movie every weekend post that first phase of weaning off
                - only if I feel like it
    - life does seem a bit more boring, which is expected and good
    - Sleeping patterns are healthier and lucidity levels are rising fairly rapidly
        - more stable dreams and generally more aware of the REM phase without any surplus significant efforts.
    - as expected, a lot of time has been freed up 
        - the key, now, is to mindfully slot in productive activities
		
### The Plan

As I previously mentioned, I still think that it is a waste of time
and attention if you don't have a definite purpose when using social
media. I have found my purpose of spreading esoteric ideas now and
will therefore return on Instagram as `The√ÜFRAISK`.  

I will primarily be using this to engage with other similar content
creators and be abstaining from posting anything that does not respect
my philosophy of being frank.  

Some other reasons for this move:
 - Several juniors who really want to get in touch with me will be
   able to do so conveniently
 - I'd better be able to propagate my ideas
 - I'm not afraid anymore to lose my style of expression : I've
   enough time in the cyber-Himalayas to be aware of its philosophical core
   
Lastly, I know that this is equivalent to: 
 - a clean fish trying to sanitize a majorly murky pond.
 - trying to pacify a bull by grabbing it right at its horns
 - <some other crude metaphor you'd like: three of a thing look good>
 
I am definitely up for the challenge and am excited to see how this
turns out.
