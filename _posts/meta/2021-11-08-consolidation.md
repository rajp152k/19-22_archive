Lately, I've been experiencing burnouts at a greater than usual
frequency due to seemingly extreme workloads. I do not know of good
ways to let go of the accumulated steam in an intermittent
fashion. I do, however, end up letting it off in unintended and
sub-optimal ways post these burnouts. These ways don't
particularly help me with the next bout of pushing through.
Finally, I do get into survival mode to pull myself out of the
quicksand of an incoming stream of work.

Occasionally, I do feel like giving up on the whole hassle of working hard
(or at least trying to..), to let go, to let life take its course.
That would be very easy and relaxing I bet. I haven't ever done so
and wouldn't be doing so, however.

I've known the following for a long time but this is the first
time I'm actually verbalizing it fairly clearly: I haven't ever had a
good plan in place to relax.

I, however, do end up chancing upon things that feel good but I never
do hold on to them. Reading is fine but I'm slowly saturating in terms
of new ideas to be encountered and stimulated by. I don't usually read
fiction and haven't been able to figure out exactly why, because I am
a very active movie buff: I carefully choose the good ones, and
criticize them non-numerically, and intend that those 150
minutes were really well spent. I can't watch movies all the time:
they're only good once a week. Reading non-fiction is my thing but it
is not particularly enticing when you're at your lowest in the middle
of the day. I enjoy working out but I do that first thing in the
morning and hence can't use that to let off any steam during the
day. I was a retro-gamer but I don't want to spend anymore time in
front of a computer screen than necessary with the same posture for a
long duration. Walking with music or podcasts seems good but it's not
particularly attractive. Boredom feels good and right some days but is
unbearable when, again, you're at your lowest.


I have been journaling fairly frequently for the past month (tends to
go up during stressful times) and midst the rants and chore-ish logs,
I do end up having some good observations. That feels unusually satisfying.


I plan to deterministically write every day at the end of the
day: with wanting to write at any other time left to my whims: the end
is deterministic.

 Surprisingly, typing feels better than writing with a
 pencil. I'm going to relax by consolidating my days at
their ends. I will be bored some days but I'll push through - will not
be actively seeking any sort of excessive stimulation for some time.

I start today, at the cusp of another burnout, hence
the slightly repetitive and zombie-ish structure of this post
today. My future self would probably excuse that.
