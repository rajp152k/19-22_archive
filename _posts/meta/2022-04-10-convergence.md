For the last week, I haven't been writing or shooting any videos:
took a subconscient[^1] break from any sort of creation and have been
consuming a lot of content.   

Now, I return with a whole bunch of novel ideas and the will to
create - a lot more. Reading was still on track and helped keep me
sane.  

The last two weeks were mostly a consolidation of what I'd been doing
for the long past: I am forward-looking again with all the lessons
that I've extracted and shall create again with greater vigor and
enthusiasm than I previously exhibited.  

After the breakup, I've realized that although my life was pretty
well structured already, being in a relationship does make you
complacent and hides the parts where you lack and could use some
tending to.  

Not to say that relationships aren't good: I've learned a lot which I
can't imagine obtaining without these past two years of sharing a part
of myself with someone - it makes you realize what "you" actually
are.  

Right now, I am back on working towards what I want to work on and am excited for
all that remains to be experienced.

Undigressing[^1], the point of this post is to cater to the
interference that the conversational rhetoric pursuit has caused in my
writing pursuit. The week before the last one, I only shot videos and
did not write at all. That is fine as that felt natural in the
moment.  

However, I've noticed that I still want to write as writing is what
helps me express myself the most clearly. Moreover, I am not
delivering a lot of value right now in the conversations and if I am
to really improve upon my conversational rhetoric, the topic needs a
stable backbone to be able to be adopted as the core of a
conversation.  

Therefore, I've decided to write a blog for every video I post. I'll
write beforehand - this is going to be with minimal planning and
upon glancing upon what I've written, I'll talk about the topic in
the videos. Albeit, still keeping it natural and unscripted.  

This should enhance the content of the videos, simultaneously allowing
me to maintain my writing pursuits.  

Undigressing[^1] again, convergence refers to my new-found wisdom to start with a
pursuit imperfectly, iterate - figuring what works and what doesn't,
and enjoying what it evolves into,
keeping the core philosophical principles intact along the way. There
is always a subconscient[^1] meta-convergence that takes care of the
nature of those principles, however.. 

This blog and YouTube should help me in converging upon my style of
abstractualizing[^1] my experiences, the one that I enjoy the most.
