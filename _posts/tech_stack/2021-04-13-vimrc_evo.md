Fairly recent rc can be found [here](https://github.com/rajp152k/configs/blob/main/vim/.vimrc)

## RC Log 

- a timestamped log of all the changes to my vimrc with some wisdom and insight as to why so...
- goal is to capture the evolution of my rc 
- also some things learned along the way

### Sat Apr 24 19:57:41 IST 2021

 - shifting to Emacs with Evil mode
 - vim is a backup option now
 - will update on the tech stack once the migration is complete
 - TBH, Evil emulates vim fairly well
 - All the things that I'll have to learn to become an emacs superuser were anyway on my list
    - I'll choose lisp any day over vim-script

### Tue Apr 13 21:09:50 IST 2021
 
 - incorporating evolution as an active stream today onwards
 - last major update was implementation of a scroll bar for popups using vimscript
 - yet to optimize the algorithm : it's slow and ugly right now
 - as a consequence of handling a lot of big, fat, ugly data for databases assignment : added support for large files
 - also looking into machine code and assembly for a while now: included triggers for binary buffers

### Tue Feb  9 16:02:24 IST 2021

 - shifted all ab's to iab's

### Sat Jan 30 16:21:54 IST 2021

 - segmented vimrc into folds and pruned off some unnecessary plugins
 - shifting to using `ZZ` as default quitter
 - some self-imposed mapping rules
     - any meta-ops : use control
     - any new buffer creations/edits : use leader (SPACE)
 - commenting post mappings :
    ```
    It is not possible to put a comment after these commands, because the '"'
    character is considered to be part of the {lhs} or {rhs}. However, one can
    use |", since this starts a new, empty command with a comment.
    ```
 - upgrading vimrc buffer pullup and sources to 3 stroke maps
    ```
    nnoremap <leader>ev :vs $MYVIMRC<Cr>
    nnoremap <leader>sv :source $MYVIMRC <Cr>
    ```

 - upper U , lower u in visual mode
    - `map  <c-u> vawUw`
    - handy for something like CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
 - to remove a mapping, there's the usual unmap with modifiers
 - `map - ddp` to move a line down and `map _ ddkkp` to move a line up
 - `10-` (or 10_)will treat 10 lines as a chunk 
 - to know what keystrokes are captured when typing a meta key: 
    - hit <c-v> in insert mode and then the key
 - included a map for logging with timestamps
    - the k and J after the return to get the date inserted on the same line
    - output from `r!` inserts an extra \n in the end
 - maps also included for editing and sourcing vimrc
 - another map for quick access to the terminal
    ```
    map <leader>l :r!date <Cr> k J
    map <leader>e :vs ~/.vimrc <Cr>
    map <leader>s :source ~/.vimrc <Cr>
    map <leader>t :ter <Cr>
    ```
 - setting line number and relative line number : 
 - line number shows the current line number as absolute and relative line number shows the others as relative : use both 
    ```
    set relativenumber
    set number
    ```
