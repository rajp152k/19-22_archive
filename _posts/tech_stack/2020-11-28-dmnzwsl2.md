Recently (about a month ago), I had to re-setup my work environment due to some corruptions in my file system (the fast ring (dev) builds of Microsoft's insider are glitchy).

So that led to a couple of conscious selection points, summarized here:
 - upgraded to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
 - started using the unofficial jonathanf vim PPA for getting on to V8.2
    - not getting on to neovim yet but sometime soon, just cause the philosophical differences in development compared to vim (vim 8+ and neovim don't deviate drastically yet)
 - shifted to powerline for all (vim,tmux and shell) rather than a different setup for all
 - not just the tools but also my habits with how I use them
 - vim is now my multiplexer as well : I always liked vim buffers more than tmux 
     - way more sensible default switching key-bindings
     - use tmux only to dispatch a process for long
     - integrated a customizable repl in vim and feel the editing environment to be more complete than that of tmux + vim(editor only) for general scripting and daily stuff

Heading to what I originally intended for, WSL2 can be daemonized now (the system initialization pid 1 issue can be handled), still in a very hackish way though.

I had to revisit this again due to virtualization issues (first addressed [here]({% post_url /tech_stack/2020-08-17-techstack %})) encountered in a computer networking class.

So.., here is a collection of references if I do need to get down and dirty in the rabbit hole of environment configuration sometime in the future: 
 - [init pid'd to 1](https://github.com/DamionGans/ubuntu-wsl2-systemd-script)
     - try `systemctl restart libvirtd` if you do face an issue with a daemon (libvirtd in this case)
 - [GUI setup with any Xserver](https://medium.com/@japheth.yates/the-complete-wsl2-gui-setup-2582828f4577)
 - if virtualizing via wsl2, also set `nestedVirtualization=true` in your wslconf as stated [here](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4193#issuecomment-622082650)

What this means is that given the coupling of kvm with wsl2, I can run virtual machines fairly cheaply compared to that of using a level 1 hypervisor like virtual box ( even qemu + wsl2 fairs pretty well).
Thanks to the fact that wsl2 and kvm, both are level 2 hypervisors and that microsoft ships a complete linux kernel with recent Windows builds.
