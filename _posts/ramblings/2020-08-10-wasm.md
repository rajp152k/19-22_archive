This is what has been infesting my dreams lately (probably a lie).  

I hinted at getting started with some new tools on my generic stream updates which included assembly for my new reverse engineering fun-project.  

And this.., this was love at first site (suits better than sight).  

Let me elaborate...(Pre-Script : My story telling skills are too good (to be comprehensible ?))  

## Story time

There's this normal wannabe code junkie moving about his day and walking around having numerous "ideorgasms".  

(He's developing his own dialect : and this is an idea-induced-orgasm. He probably will create a map soon enough; also generate his own grammar while he's at it; Linguistics is an old friend)  

Proceeding: He starts with this full stack deep learning project and extrapolates his imagination. All the deployment options and issues make him look around a bit and get a feel of the lands - they are vast.   

He then finds out these lands are divided : development, machine learning, crowd sourcing data, presenting all this in a presentable format ; connected with bridges (or pipelines).  

He soon realizes that analogizing restricted to the earth is not enough. So let's say the earth is his workstation and there exist other workstations- say planets and these big giants : stars making up the galaxy and hence the universe (his universe to be precise : DO NOT FACT-CHECK, EVER).  
So, habitants of a planet can see others via photons - packets of data ( or imagine rivers of bit streams if you're a wavey, gooey person ).
So the Internet would be the simultaneous passing around and meaningful reception of these photons. A star would probably be a data-center. What he realizes is inter-galactic communication is the key to leveraging all that is possible without reinventing nuclear fusion (the wheel ?).   

He then moves on to understanding the presently established communication channel : electromagnetic waves (accept it or not : Javascript).  
Well, He's pretty impressed with all these frequencies (dialects of Javascript) doing their own job : ranging from Elm looking out for the evolved Saturns and vanilla javascript looking out for the slightly primitive and unstructured Mercury :- it does the job) and informational entropy (I'm definitely using it in the wrong sense) does its thing and VOILA : He discovers Gravitational Waves : This literally breaks barriers : that of time and space, bending it at will and mocking upon euclidean Laws (again, DO NOT FACT-CHECK, if you can that is) - (rapid, minimalistic byte code compilation target : WebAssembly, if you're following)  

What he enjoys even more is that these gravitational waves intermingle intricately with relativistic quantum mechanics ( the beloved C++ : not a language : cause it can do(reason about) *anything*) and its type-safe non-relativistic consort: Rust.

This just made life a little bit more interesting. 

## Learnings

 - got to know the textual representation of wasm (WebAssembly) can be interpreted in multiple ways :- Abstract Syntax Trees, as a stack machine (different from the call stack) and source maps coming soon: consequences follow
 - If you still don't get why I'm this euphoric, I can write C++ on the web - which is  portable (wasm interpreted by most browsers now) and build progressive web apps (soon) with my current C++ development environment; was going to grasp dart(and hence flutter) otherwise.
 - I'll still have to do that I believe cause Javascript is still good to know about and yeah, it's still and probably will be ubiquitous.

## Consequences

 - I found a pretty good target for my reverse engineering exploration (check project inception section); if not wasm, it would've been x86 or ARM or other simplified stuff(MIPS); but now, we got wasm - we'll wasm.
 - check out the [Web Assembly Explorer](https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/) if you'd like to get on the wagon.
 - I realize, I'm a *bad* narrator and probably need to tone down the inaccurate analogies
 - Nah, screw that. I do what I want.
