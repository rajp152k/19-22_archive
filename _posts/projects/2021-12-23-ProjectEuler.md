## [2021-12-23 Thu 21:52] - 7906

Project Euler via Racket: featuring my first chronologically ascending stream.
 - features commentary on insights required and intellectual
   increments
 - code posted at : [Project Euler](https://github.com/rajp152k/Project-Euler)


## P1 - 7906

	- recently finished chapter 3 of SICP
		- still under the influence of streams
	- (accumulate (filter (generate .. )))

## P2 - 7906

	- shifting back to some basic tail-recursion ideas
	- memoized streams would do too

## P3 - 7906

	- streams and tail-recursion
	
## P4 - 7909

	- using these simple problems to get familiar with streams
	- stateless approach again

## P5 - 7909
	
	- just warming up..
		
## P6 - 7910
	
	- approached programmatically even though closed-from expressions exist
	
## P7 - 7924

	- streams too slow
	- density of primes is asymptotically 1/log(n)
	- feasible to overshoot: sieve till 1e6
	
## P8 - 7924

	- basic list manipulations
	- analogous to signal processing (aids with functional approach)
	- duplication, truncation, application specific merge/collation
      does it
	  
## P9 - 7924

	- procedural approach would be 3 for loops
	- did it with 2-tier heirarchical tail recursion
		- recursion and iteration are computationally equipotent
		
## P10 - 7924

	- accumulate post the sieve from p7
	
### Detour

	- venturing into typed racket before proceeding with the
      consequent problems
