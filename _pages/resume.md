#### Languages

	- Lisp
	- Python
	- C++
	
These were some languages that I've actively invested the effort into
studying.
Moreover, I'm generically interested in Programming Language
Pragmatics and what goes on under the hood. Consequently, I am an
ethical hacker and do not limit myself to the bounds of any particular
paradigm - I'll get on with whatever lies in front of me, unless of
course the job itself demands optimization

	
#### Frameworks and Meta-Tools

	- Pytorch
	- FastAI
	- Latex
	- the Unix Philosophy
	- the GNU Philosophy

### Extracurricular

Several undocumented projects can be found in the corners of this blog

I do sort of everything and do not limit myself to my "job
description". I break more stuff than I create. I would make for a
good penetration tester I guess.

#### Fitsoc aka F-society

 - Created my own hybrid athleticism club that focused on work life
   balance for a college student while having fun and being very ambitious
 - couldn't finally formalize this, but the club is still somewhat
   intact on social media and we continue to propagate our philosophy
   of not sacrificing anything : aka trying to achieve it all.

	you are wise
	- I'm keeping this so that I remember that I made this mistake and
	don't do it the future
	- moral of the story : don't think I'm a good writer
