	speech have been noted

### Thu Jul  8 05:36:53 IST 2021

	- halfway through my internship 
		- made considerable progress
	- caught a bad cold day before yesterday
		- no workouts, sub-optimal sleep
			- relatively sub-par period in my life
		- hit the state trough yesterday morning and on my path to
		recover
	- taking a course on fundamental music theory
		- as touted by me before, I would like to play than only
		listen
		

### Wed Jun 16 10:43:23 IST 2021

	- a bird took a shit right beside my keyboard two days ago.
		- forgot to log this as that was also my first day as a summer
		analyst at Goldman Sachs (Controllers division).
		- came in all the way from a window two rooms away and
		panicked when I entered my room post workout.
		- couldn't get out and kept on pecking into the window at the
		same point (dumb bird (I'm not an ornithologist))

	- changing the format of these logs as requested by another
	one of my friends : correctly pointed out that horizontal
	scrolling is a pain.
		- discovered the autofill-mode in emacs; hooked
		it to markdown mode and set the fill-collumn default
		to 60 : so that takes care of hard wrapping on its
		own.
	- Only changing the last log and starting from here, will be
	following the following:

```elisp
(use-package markdown-mode
  :straight t
  :config 
  (set-fill-column 60)
  (general-add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook
		    (list 'nlinum-relative-mode
			  'auto-fill-mode)))
```

	- Now that I'm only 20 days away from the commencement 
	of my summer internship within the Controllers division 
	at Goldman, will begin diving deep into derivatives trading
	- thinking of "Options, Futures and Other Derivatives"

### Wed May 26 18:31:58 IST 2021

	- one of my friends suggested that I start a YouTube channel
		- vlogging being the primary way people choose to
		document their experiments in 2021
	- not a bad idea but seems time consuming as of now 
	- sometime down the lane, that is a definite but just not now
	- writing is fun and I'm not doing this for the
	views/reach so  that kinda settles it
		- but that is against the explorative and curious
		attitude  I intend to cultivate and inspire
	- a basic entry point could be casts of my work
	environment or just a channel that discusses new
	subjects that arise at the intersection of pre-existing ones
		- that would definitely accelerate my polymathic persuits
	- One thing I want to stay far away from is becoming one
	of those "YA ... Y" channels
		- that's yet another ... youtube channel
	- OR .... that is a good name : "YA ... Y" Channel
		- the ellipsis capture the implied global closure of
		the channel's contents
		- well : could give it a try anyway ...

### Tue May 25 13:17:26 IST 2021

	- I am beginning to forget the characteristic tunes and rythms of songs that I used to hear daily (workouts and walks)
	- unable to recall them on demand even if I try
	- because what the society around me hears is not my choice and is not periodic / repititive enough : those tunes do not stick
	- feels weird : can roughly recall the rythms but they're not quite right : not sustainable : feels somewhat mysterious
		- usually struggled to get tunes out of my head, now I can't seem to get a hand of one that sticks.
		- definitely frees up the mind for other things you might want to think about.

### Sat May 22 20:48:26 IST 2021
	
	- watched "The Big Short" (2015 : Adam McKay) today
	- thinking of giving up music and podcasts for a while

[One Arm Pushups: init]({% post_url /fitness/2021-05-21-fitness-log-006 %}){: .btn .btn--inverse}

	- I fortuitously fasted yesterday just cause I forgot to eat amidst some work and I recalled how I felt during my 48 hour weekend fasts.
		- my longest was a 60 hour water fast and by the end of these, ketones kick in along with the superhuman focus : it's enjoyable
		- time-wise, this is way more convenient
	- decided today that I'll be having only one meal a day (lunch) but that I'll be eating almost the same
		- so that's 10 whole eggs, a lot of veggies, 150 grams of lentils, curd, and the usual indian carbs (chapattis) in one meal
		- liquid calories to a minimum : two protein shakes
	- will have to shift my cardio sessions to morning though : pushups and pullups remain alloted to evenings
	- will revise this once the gyms reopen and I'm back on my regimen.
	- Monsoon has almost begun and the winds are colder now, ice baths are way more fun now

### Tue May 18 16:38:09 IST 2021

	- Latin on hold(already has been for a long time) until I finish off the Speed reading Logs.
	- resuming SICP with racket : programming lisp in emacs is way more fun
		- although I had a repl setup in vim : lisp was just another language
		- in emacs, you get to get to know how certain parts of the editor are implemented as you learn.
	- Watched "Tenet" (2020 : Christopher Nolan) day before yesterday : will log this.

### Sun May 16 08:29:53 IST 2021
	
	- It's been 30 days for me to give up consuming visual media for entertainment
	- will follow up with a post about the experience
	- Hard-rules are good : that helped me get through this -> never trust your future self
	- going to watch one movie every weekend(including today) for 5 more weeks i.e. will revise the rules again on <2021-06-20 Sun>
	  - no loop holes : one movie, weekend : all else remains the same

### Thu May  6 21:44:51 IST 2021

	 - Augmented the Learning queue to include time-stamps
		 - should capture the movement fairly well
	 - Looking forward to write more often this summer
	 - Reading Bruce Lee's Biography (by Matthew Polly)

### Tue May  4 22:37:35 IST 2021

     - setting up org-gtd for workflow
     - org-roam for research and conceptual notes
     - learning elisp
     - Internship has been postponed and shrunken to 6 weeks
       - will leverage for some research output

### Fri Apr 30 19:58:03 IST 2021

     - Turning 21 tomorrow
     - should document that somewhere

### Tue Apr 27 20:26:24 IST 2021

     - Learning Emacs is a pretty intense process
     - Evil does help but I've been grinding to adapt my complete workflow
       - probably not the best way to go about the integration, but I don't want to spend a lot of time in a sub-optimal state
       - anyway, have been making extremely rapid progress and will flag the migration as daemonized on the major stream when emacs really becomes self-documenting for me.
     - Emacs pinky is a thing : I use cherry-MX blues with a large travel and that doesn't help
     - have been making a lot of choices

### Sat Apr 24 19:57:41 IST 2021

     - shifting to Emacs with Evil mode
     - vim is a backup option now
     - will update on the tech stack once the migration is complete
     - TBH, Evil emulates vim fairly well
     - All the things that I'll have to learn to become an emacs superuser were anyway on my list
        - I'll choose lisp any day over vim-script
     - archiving .vimrc evolution
