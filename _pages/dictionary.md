# Init [2022-01-28 Fri 20:00] - 7942

A collation of words and phrases, used for the first time (to the best
of my knowledge), in my blogs.  
I also happen to discover a lot of etymological dead ends when
writing. They are not technically neologisms and shall be followed by
an indicator (PN). in this log to indicate the same. However, whatever I
include here is something that my editor rejects with the red
squigglies (like squigglies (the actual word is squiggles)) and I
still wish to use that word to honestly portray how my mind tries
articulating my thoughts. These shall be named as "PseudoNeologisms" -
first used by me circa 2022-03-25 Fri 18:39.  
Moreover, If I'm going to build my own set of vocabulary and the way I talk in these blogs, I'd
like to represent phrasal abstractions (that's really just "phrases":
I'm definitely a gnomenphomaniac) conveniently: they shall also be
logged in here and will be indicated by a (ABR).
