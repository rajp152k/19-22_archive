	- beginning my first read of "The Divine Comedy"

### [2021-10-03 Sun 07:39] - 7826

	- To be more aware of how I grow up: beginning to date my posts
	with the number of days I've been alive as well.
		- a difference of ~400 days feels longer to me psychologically
		right now than one year. Imagine "I'm a year older" v/s "I'm
		365 days older".
	- I personally don't know Jesus and I get that societal
	cooperation depends on everyone agreeing on common standards but
	that feels personally detached
	- Consequently, will continue with the conventional time stamps as well 
	- day-stamps change at my birth time (1930) and include the
	present day : to be treated as the running day
		- technically should be stamping as 7826th but that is ugly

	- have been using `r!date` since 2nd August 2020 (3 days in to the
	start of this blog) : served me well
	- now that I've migrated to emacs, shifting to "C-u M-x org-time-stamp"
		- binding to "C-u C-c !" globally
		- a couple more keystrokes and goes through a selection menu
		but much more inclusive
	- All time stamps hence forth would be readily parsable in
	org-mode
	- the beginning of migrating from markdown to org-mode as my principal 
	writing markup dialect
	- would explicitly mention time-zone differences ; IST is a redundancy
	- beginning to incorporate a more project based approach for all
	that I do :
		- actively logging (quantitavely and qualitatively) about the
		finer details in my org-roam knowledge web
			- this seems to be my final root setup for logging given
			all the other platforms I've tried over the past two years
			(Notion, Obsidian, VimWiki, One-Note, Notebooks only . 
				- the most powerful(flexible) yet the most simple and
				elegant way
		- still do have a notebook on me all the time 
		- serves as an immutable store without any
		garbage-collection : no deletions, only condensations ...
			- prominent ideas are regularly assimilated in the knowledge web 
		- should be intriguing to revisit them after significant intervals
		- assuming infinite supply
		- would rather have a "notebookshelf" than a bookshelf

### Sat Apr 24 20:08:09 IST 2021

    - beginning my stay with emacs soon; the soul of vim continues to live on within Evil.
        - vim has given me a lot and my time with it shall never be forgotten.
    - beginning a Latin only stream: where I write only in Latin; should accelerate the process and I'm genuinely excited to write within the linguistic bounds of a 4-year old again.
        - Idea is to capture my progress with latin.
            - Today I begin with the shortest sentence I know:
                - I am.
            - When I die, I'll schedule a push for an:
                - I was.
            - sounds fun.

### Sun Apr 18 19:40:04 IST 2021

    - have quit social media(deleted accounts : facebook and instagram)
        - had already been off the platforms for a couple of months so this isn't cold-turkey
        - this did put a smile on my face : unexpected energy surge immediately after the deletion
        - ofcourse, other more active forms of leisure are being incorporated
    - also quit television and all other forms of visual entertainment (2 days in now)
        - this is cold turkey
        - plan to stick to this for a long time but hard rules are good to avoid loopholes and gray areas
            - no visual entertainment for 30 days : that's pretty simple
                - followed by one movie every weekend post that first phase of weaning off
                - only if I feel like it
    - life does seem a bit more boring, which is expected and good
    - Sleeping patterns are healthier and lucidity levels are rising fairly rapidly
        - more stable dreams and generally more aware of the REM phase without any surplus significant efforts.
    - as expected, a lot of time has been freed up 
        - the key, now, is to mindfully slot in productive activities

### Sat Apr 10 10:17:41 IST 2021

    - bad week(month?(year?)) sleep wise : need to get that back in check
    - starting a log stream for any skills I want to pick up
        - streams are the way to go for intermittent updates and staying on track
    - began with the speed reading log today under the meta category
        - not going to post the links for such streams on the major or minor stream
        - so consider yourself lucky if you chance upon them

     - drew my left hand with my right hand, just out of curiosity probably the first time after kinder-garden
        - they definitely had something right cooking with the kind of stuff they made us do
     - shifted to using the mouse with my left hand - full time
        - slow but definitely improving incrementally: frees up my right for some doodling

### Fri Aug  7 21:33:14 IST 2020

	- no sun rise today, rainy day; the hike was even better
		- a walk in the clouds.
	- as I was going to get into javascripts, basic research led me to the idea of
		- WebAssembly
		- Edge Computing
		- writing Web Apps in native code (C,C++,Rust) rather than javascript dialects
	- very interesting, and definitely getting in on that
	- though learning javascript will still be useful
	- the idea of serverless serving is very intriguing though.
	- thinking of creating a separate stream for my learning log and my generic log so that things look more structured.

### Thu Aug  6 21:56:42 IST 2020

	- started working on a personal full stack deep learning project
		- will learn a lot about a range of technologies and tools in the process
	- first book review coming soon: Descartes error is turning out pretty good albeit felt like a slog at a point of time
	- started solo hiking 2 days ago; tomorrow is the second day; targeting to scale the peak before 0615 IST(before sunrise)
	- decided to add a couple of tool stacks to my repertoire soon:
		- javascript and soon its relevant dialects:- they're ubiquitous and will help me understand a lot of the web and build stuff
		- assembly:- I was smitten after I checked a blog post about compiler optimization just cause how elegant it was
		- modern C++ :- already have a head start on this and yes, it's a different language from C++ 11 onwards; the power it gives the programmer is just amazing. What people say is true:- the worst part is that it's too low a level and the best part is it's too low a level.
			- specifically because it's a multiparadigm'd language, I'm interested how a functional approach plays out here
			- getting familiar with it's type system and the idea of perfect forwarding:- the code just feels so much more expressive now.

### Sun Aug  2 23:05:33 IST 2020

	- setting up some smooth navigation and a way for intermittent updates
	- I'm not peculiar, just lazy... ; started using r!date 
		- probably will create a dynamic tech stack page soon

### 31 - 07 - 2020
