These are archived logs pertaining to my pursuits when
I was completing my undergrad at IITH (CSE major and AI minor).

I've stopped blogging pseudo-scientifically and proceed 
with this pursuit in a more organized way.

Several posts have been replaced by sentinels to avoid breaking linkages.

I'm still keeping this repository public as an evidence that there is a lot
of value in blogging : however petty your pursuits might seem to you in the
moment.

I attribute most of my personal growth to this blog but tbh, it is a mess
and I need a fresh start.

Will definitely miss writing the way this blog allowed me to (without caring 
what the world thinks)

Might revive this style of writing someday when I've more time to kill.
As of now, I've to grow up and need to cut down on my hobbies.

If you're reading this sometime in the future,
do consider raising an issue mentioning exactly what led you here...

Thanks,
Raj
